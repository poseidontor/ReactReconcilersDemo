## ReactReconcilersDemo

This project is a custom implementation of a React reconciler, designed to efficiently update the DOM based on changes in the application state. React reconcilers are at the core of React's ability to efficiently update the user interface by determining what parts of the DOM need to be updated, added, or removed when the state of a React component changes.


##### Problem Statement
Donâ€™t clear the DOM upfront, update it based on what has changed.
Question is, how does it calculate what all has changed?
Has a todo been removed from the backend?
